# Lydwhitt_tools
A collection of functions and tools I have developed and find useful during my volcanology PhD. 

Whilst I have a lot of tools and functions in my computer that I use regularly I haven't yet put them all in a place to help others. Theres a lot of very simple tasks that waste time that I've c reated tools to complete that I will be adding to this repository over time. I started collating this in August 2025 so bare with me whilst I get it going.
